## **3. Token Technology**

### **Smart Contract Overview**

Tonos (TONS) is based on the **OpenZeppelin ERC20 standard**. This ensures full compatibility with Ethereum wallets, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and DeFi platforms. The smart contract includes the following core functionalities:

- **Token Transfer**: `transfer(address to, uint256 amount)` allows users to transfer TONS tokens between wallets.
- **Allowance System**: `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)` lets users delegate transfer authority to third parties.
- **Balance Check**: `balanceOf(address account)` allows querying the balance of any wallet address.

The contract also implements standard security features, such as overflow protection and allowance race condition mitigation.

## **4. Tokenomics**

- **Total Supply**: 180 billion TONS tokens minted at the contract’s deployment.
- **Decimals**: 18, ensuring fine granularity in token transactions.
- **Initial Distribution**: All tokens were minted and allocated to the deployer’s wallet.
